# Deep Learning and Machine Learning Models Repository

Welcome to the Deep Learning and Machine Learning Models Repository! This collection features a diverse set of models, including classical machine learning algorithms and state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. The repository is organized into two main sections:

## Features

### Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Linear Regression**: Predictive modeling technique used for regression analysis.
- **Logistic Regression**: Classification algorithm for binary classification problems.
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks.
- **XGBoostRegressor**: Gradient boosting framework known for its speed and performance.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Tree-like model used for classification.

### Deep Learning Models
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Deep learning architecture designed for image and visual data processing.
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: General-purpose deep learning architecture for various tasks.
- **Plant Disease Classification**: Utilizing CNNs for identifying plant diseases from images.
- **Food Classification**: Applying deep learning to classify different types of food items.
- **Handwritten Digit Classification**: Using neural networks to recognize and classify handwritten digits.
